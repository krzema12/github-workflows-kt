YAMLs and JSONs surround us more and more frequently. While their syntax is simple and they allow defining hierarchical
data easily, the tendency is also to overuse them for more complicated scenarios where a power of a regular programming
language would be beneficial. This library aims at filling this gap, utilizing Kotlin as a modern general-purpose
language with good internal DSL support.
