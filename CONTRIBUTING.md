# Contributing guidelines

Thanks for finding a moment for your contribution! We really appreciate it!
The below rules are here to speed things up and streamline work on both sides - us as library maintainers and you as the contributor.

## Reporting a bug

First check if it's not already reported. Use the "bug" tag for filtering.
If it's not, create a new one using the template. If it already exists, give it a thumb-up and optionally share any helpful details in the comments.

## Requesting a feature

There's also a designated template for it, and the rule of checking if the request is already tracked also applies.

## Contributing a feature

Each feature contribution must have an accompanying feature request issue, best if we discuss the approach in the issue first to avoid misunderstandings and wasted time. If the feature is simple, go ahead with creating the issue and the PR in parallel.

If you're creating a new feature branch in this repository (doesn't count if it's your fork), it has to start with issue number, e.g. `123-new-steps-API`, and the issue has to be open. Otherwise, the branch is assumed to be safe to delete.
