# Getting started

As an exercise, we'll add a job that prints out `Hello world!`. Feel free to replace the actual workflow's logic and all
names with your own.

1. Install Kotlin as a stand-alone binary, e.g. from Snap Store when on Linux:
   ```
   sudo snap install kotlin --classic
   ```
   Make sure this is the newest version available. Kotlin scripting still has some rough edges, and improvements
   are introduced with each new Kotlin release.
   Also make sure that you use Java 11+.
2. Create a new executable file in your repository:
   ```
   touch    .github/workflows/hello_world_workflow.main.kts
   chmod +x .github/workflows/hello_world_workflow.main.kts
   ```
   This location is not a hard requirement, it's just recommended for consistency with enforced location of actual
   GitHub Actions workflows.
3. Put this content into the previously created file and save it:
   ```kotlin
   --8<-- "GettingStartedSnippets.kt:getting-started-1"
   --8<-- "GettingStartedSnippets.kt:getting-started-2"
   --8<-- "GettingStartedSnippets.kt:getting-started-3"
   ```
   Explanation: first, we create a workflow with the DSL provided by this library. The reason it needs source
   file path is to be able to generate consistency checks, to ensure that both source and target files are in sync.
   You'll see it in a moment in the generated file. What's written to the `workflow` variable is an object of type
   `io.github.typesafegithub.workflows.domain.Workflow`, it's not a YAML yet. However, a call to `writeToFile()`
   extension function does the final piece of job.  
4. Generate the YAML by calling the above script:
   ```
   .github/workflows/hello_world_workflow.main.kts
   ```
   It can be also executed straight from IntelliJ, by clicking the green ▶️ button next to the shebang.
   Notice that there's an extra job generated by the library that regenerates the YAML in job's runtime and ensures that
   it's equal to the YAML committed to the repository.
5. Commit both files, push the changes to GitHub and make sure the workflow is green when ran on GitHub Actions.
