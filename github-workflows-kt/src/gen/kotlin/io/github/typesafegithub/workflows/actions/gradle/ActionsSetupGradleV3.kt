/**
 * Action: Setup Gradle
 *
 * Configures Gradle for GitHub actions, caching state and generating a dependency graph via
 * Dependency Submission.
 *
 * [Action on GitHub](https://github.com/gradle/actions/tree/v3/setup-gradle)
 *
 * @param gradleVersion Gradle version to use. If specified, this Gradle version will be downloaded,
 * added to the PATH and used for invoking Gradle.
 * @param cacheDisabled When 'true', all caching is disabled. No entries will be written to or read
 * from the cache.
 * @param cacheReadOnly When 'true', existing entries will be read from the cache but no entries
 * will be written.
 * By default this value is 'false' for workflows on the GitHub default branch and 'true' for
 * workflows on other branches.
 * @param cacheWriteOnly When 'true', entries will not be restored from the cache but will be saved
 * at the end of the Job.
 * Setting this to 'true' implies cache-read-only will be 'false'.
 * @param cacheOverwriteExisting When 'true', a pre-existing Gradle User Home will not prevent the
 * cache from being restored.
 * @param cacheEncryptionKey A base64 encoded AES key used to encrypt the configuration-cache data.
 * The key is exported as 'GRADLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY' for later steps.
 * A suitable key can be generated with `openssl rand -base64 16`.
 * Configuration-cache data will not be saved/restored without an encryption key being provided.
 * @param gradleHomeCacheIncludes Paths within Gradle User Home to cache.
 * @param gradleHomeCacheExcludes Paths within Gradle User Home to exclude from cache.
 * @param gradleHomeCacheCleanup When 'true', the action will attempt to remove any stale/unused
 * entries from the Gradle User Home prior to saving to the GitHub Actions cache.
 * @param addJobSummary Specifies when a Job Summary should be inluded in the action results. Valid
 * values are 'never', 'always' (default), and 'on-failure'.
 * @param addJobSummaryAsPrComment Specifies when each Job Summary should be added as a PR comment.
 * Valid values are 'never' (default), 'always', and 'on-failure'. No action will be taken if the
 * workflow was not triggered from a pull request.
 * @param dependencyGraph Specifies if a GitHub dependency snapshot should be generated for each
 * Gradle build, and if so, how. Valid values are 'disabled' (default), 'generate',
 * 'generate-and-submit', 'generate-and-upload', 'download-and-submit' and 'clear'.
 * @param dependencyGraphContinueOnFailure When 'false' a failure to generate or submit a dependency
 * graph will fail the Step or Job. When 'true' a warning will be emitted but no failure will result.
 * @param artifactRetentionDays Specifies the number of days to retain any artifacts generated by
 * the action. If not set, the default retention settings for the repository will apply.
 * @param buildScanPublish Set to 'true' to automatically publish build results as a Build Scan on
 * scans.gradle.com.
 * For publication to succeed without user input, you must also provide values for
 * `build-scan-terms-of-service-url` and 'build-scan-terms-of-service-agree'.
 * @param buildScanTermsOfServiceUrl The URL to the Build Scan速 terms of service. This input must be
 * set to 'https://gradle.com/terms-of-service'.
 * @param buildScanTermsOfServiceAgree Indicate that you agree to the Build Scan速 terms of service.
 * This input value must be "yes".
 * @param arguments Gradle command line arguments (supports multi-line input)
 * @param buildRootDirectory Path to the root directory of the build. Default is the root of the
 * GitHub workspace.
 * @param generateJobSummary When 'false', no Job Summary will be generated for the Job.
 * @param gradleHomeCacheStrictMatch When 'true', the action will not attempt to restore the Gradle
 * User Home entries from other Jobs.
 * @param workflowJobContext Used to uniquely identify the current job invocation. Defaults to the
 * matrix values for this job; this should not be overridden by users (INTERNAL).
 * @param githubToken The GitHub token used to authenticate when submitting via the Dependency
 * Submission API.
 * @param _customInputs Type-unsafe map where you can put any inputs that are not yet supported by
 * the binding
 * @param _customVersion Allows overriding action's version, for example to use a specific minor
 * version, or a newer version that the binding doesn't yet know about
